# Bochs Graphics demo for Loko

This program demonstrates how to use the Bochs Graphics Adapter (BGA)
to enable graphics and draw to the screen. For simplicity, the banked
mode is used.

Currently the program is run by an interpreter, so it draws quite
slowly.

The whole sample, including loko.obj, is MIT licensed.
