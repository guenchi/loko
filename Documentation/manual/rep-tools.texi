@subsection Disassembly

Loko can be disassembled using any regular disassembler that supports
ELF and amd64. There is also a built-in disassembler for procedures,
@pxref{Base library, disassemble}.

@subsection Debugging

Loko can be debugged with @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/, GNU
gdb} with the help of @file{loko-gdb.py}. Stack traces and pretty
printing should work. Line information is currently missing.

Scheme objects can get very big. Limit the output with e.g. @code{set
print elements 5}.

Traps from the processor are translated into conditions with a
@code{&program-counter} condition, e.g.@: this error from trying to
evaluate @code{(#f)}:

@example
 The condition has 5 components:
 1. &assertion &violation &serious
 2. &who: apply
 3. &message: "Tried to call a non-procedural object"
 4. &irritants: (#f)
 5. &program-counter: 3184533
End of condition components.
@end example

You can translate the program counter value to hex and look up the
trapping instruction with a disassembler.

@subsection Debug logs

The PC port of Loko can have debug logging redirected from the VGA
console with the @env{CONSOLE} environment variable:

@itemize
@item
@code{CONSOLE=vga} prints to the VGA text mode console.

@item
@code{CONSOLE=com1} prints to COM1 (BIOS's default baud rate).

@item
@code{CONSOLE=debug} prints to QEMU's debug console. This is enabled
with e.g. @code{-debugcon vc}.

@end itemize

@subsection Profiling

Loko on Linux can be profiled with
@url{https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page, perf}.

Some micro benchmarks can be done with the built-in procedure
@code{time-it*}.

@subsection Memory checking

It's possible to run Loko in @code{http://valgrind.org/, Valgrind}.
Valgrind does not support alignment checking, so Loko will print a
warning about that. Loko also does not use the ``red zone'', so
Valgrind will think that a lot of what Loko is doing uses
uninitialized memory. Don't believe it.

@subsection Fuzzing

Loko can be run with @url{http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/, AFL}. This
requires an instrumented binary, which has some overhead. The support
needs to be enabled in @code{(loko arch amd64 codegen)} first. Change
@code{use-branch-instrumentation} to @code{#t} and recompile.
